**Welcome to Hydro@UMass!**

This is the webpage of the Computational hydrology Research Group in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The group is led by Kostas Andreadis, and the research that we do focuses on the intersection of water resources modeling, remote sensing and in-situ observations, data fusion, and the study of large-scale hydrology as it relates to climate change and environmental monitoring.
