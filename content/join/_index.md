We will advertise any specific opportunities for graduate students or postdoctoral researchers on this page, but if you are interested in contacting us about joining the group we ask that you prepare a short letter and email to [Dr. Andreadis](mailto:kandread@umass.edu). The letter should contain:

  * A summary of research topics that excite you.
  * An overview of your academic background and prior accomplishments (including research output, diversity and outreach work)
  * Brief discussion on how your interests fit within our group's research

The research our group does heavily involve the use of computational techniques and applied mathematical/statistical methods as they apply to environmental and water resources science and practice. Although we do utilize a multitude of measurements in our work and occasionally participate in or perform field work, that is not the focus of our group's research. We aim to advance our understanding of the field of hydrology by applying computational methods so if you're primarily interested in field work or computer science our group is probably not a good fit. Researchers who join our group are expected to be motivated, driven to learn and share their knowledge, have excellent communication skills, and be committed to diversity and inclusiveness.
