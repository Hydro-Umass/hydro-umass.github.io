A [paper]({{< relref "/publication/das2024" >}}) from our collaboration with the [Faisal Hossain's](https://saswe.net/) group at the University of Washington has just been accepted for publication in the Environmental Modeling & Software journal.

The paper titled "ResORR: A Globally Scalable and Satellite Data-driven Algorithm for River Flow Regulation due to Reservoir Operations" describes a model that predicts regulated river flow from satellite observations. ResORR now has its own [software home and documentation](https://github.com/UW-SASWE/ResORR) page and is integrated into the RAT 3.0
(reservoir assessment tool) package.  As reservoir storage change and diversion estimates improve steadily over time in the era of SWOT, we expect ResORR to become a standard post processing plugin to help RAT users improve their understanding of human regulation of surface water through reservoir operations. In addition ResORR stands on its own for use with other hydrologic models or streamflow models in regulated river basins.
