abstract: "Driven by the escalating toll of catastrophic flood events worldwide, there is an ur-gent need for nuanced insights into flood dynamics that extend beyond conventionaldiscussions of climate change impacts. While the role of climate change in floods hasbeen extensively studied, the influence of land cover change has been comparativelyunderexplored. In addressing this gap, our research harnesses the Random Forest re-gression model to estimate peak discharge across a wide array of watersheds in thecontinental United States, underscoring the profound impact of Impervious SurfaceArea (ISA). A comprehensive array of hydrological and geomorphological variables wereincorporated, and their relative importance assessed. Furthermore, a stepwise regressionapproach, hyper-parameter tuning with k-fold cross validation were employed to refinethe model. Our study spans 602 unregulated watersheds, aggregating over 11,000 obser-vations across diverse geographical and climatic conditions. The findings highlight peakprecipitation and Antecedent Moisture Condition (AMC) as pivotal factors, althoughISA also had a significant impact on peak flow estimation. The modelâ€™s robustness wasaffirmed by Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) metrics, with over two-thirds of the datapoints achieving NSE values above 0.9. Our results also confirmed the ISA-peak dis-charge relationship and the model was able to reproduce it with respect to observationsin basins with urban expansion. This work thus unravels the significant role of urbandevelopment in amplifying peak discharge, furnishing a valuable framework for future hydrological modeling and shaping flood risk management strategies."
