abstract: "The Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission expected to launch
in 2021 will offer a unique opportunity to map river
discharge at an unprecedented spatial resolution globally from its observations
of water surface elevation, width and slope. Since river discharge will not be
directly observed from SWOT, a number of algorithms have been developed with
varying complexity to estimate discharge from SWOT observables. Outstanding
issues include the lack of accurate prior information and parameter
equifinality. We developed a new data assimilation discharge algorithm that aimed to overcome these
limitations by integrating a data-driven approach to estimate priors with a
model informed by hydraulic geometry relations. A comprehensive synthetic
dataset of 18 rivers was used to evaluate the algorithm and four different
configurations (rectangular channel, generic channel, and geomorphologically
classified channel with and without regularization) aiming at evaluating the impact of progressively adding hydraulic
geometry constraints to the estimation problem. The algorithm with the full set
of constraints outperformed the other configurations with median Nash-Sutcliffe
coefficients of 0.77 compared with -0.46, 0.31 and 0.66 while other error
metrics showed identical performance. Results from this study show the promise
of this hybrid data-driven approach at estimating river discharge from SWOT
observations although a number of enhancements need to be tested to improve the
operational applicability of the algorithm."
