abstract: "This study aims to enhance the discharge and drought simulation skill of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model by calibrating it against Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Enhanced L3 Radiometer Global Daily 9 km EASE-Grid Soil Moisture (SPL3SMP_E) data. The study focused on running the VIC model in the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMRB), which includes Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, and Vietnam, at a 0.05Â° grid size on a daily time step. A sensitivity analysis was conducted before the model's execution to identify the model parameters that significantly altered the soil moisture variations. The discharge simulations generated after running the VIC model are performed using four different configurations: an open loop run, a model calibrated solely with satellite soil moisture data (SMAP), a model calibrated solely with in situ discharge observations (Runoff), and a combined calibration utilizing both SMAP and streamflow data (SMAP_Runoff). Incorporating SMAP data in the calibration process improved the model discharge simulation significantly. The smaller, less regulated watershed (Phienluang) benefits the most, with a substantial increase of 130% and 28% in the NSE compared to the open loop and Runoff-only calibration methods. These findings open its application in estimating river discharge in ungauged catchments where obtaining discharge data is not feasible due to topographical and economic restrictions. The calibrated model using SMAP data was then used to create a soil moisture climatology to identify drought regions in the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMRB). Despite the model calibration being performed between 2015 to 2022 (SMAP data collection period), there was a notable enhancement in the ability to capture the onset, severity, and persistence of the historical drought that was spatially and temporally more consistent with the drought as reports by the Mekong River Commission. The skill improvement in drought estimation was more prominent in the Central Lower Mekong River basin and Mekong River Delta agricultural region. Accurate representation of soil moisture dynamics and drought events has important implications for the study area's water resource management and agricultural planning."
