abstract: Small  hydropower (SHP) has  the  potential  to  improve  energy  access  in  developing  regions across  the  world,  particularly  in  remote, headwater  areas where grid  extension is resource intensive.   However, the cumulative   environmental   impacts   of SHP when   developed extensively can be detrimental, thus it is important to assess and balance these against the power benefits.  The  first  stepto  do this is  to  developa  model  that  can  accurately  estimate SHP potential across a catchment down to the smallest reaches. Such a model should be applicable to data  scarce  catchments, and characterisethe  uncertainty  in the  estimated  potential. Accordingly,  this  work  presents  a  linked  land  surface â€“hydraulic  model  driven  by  satellite radar  rainfall data to  estimate SHP potential  across  a  data scarce basin.  It  extends  previous modelling  efforts  by  simulating SHP potential  in  a  spatially  explicit  manner  down  to 90m resolution,  and  propagating  error  due  to  the  significant  uncertainty  in  satellite  rainfall data using the covariance of the residuals between  satellite and ground true rainfall observations. This generates a plausible range in power estimates due to rainfall uncertainty. The model is applied to the Pungwe Basin in Mozambique/Zimbabwe, and its ability to predict the location and  available  power of  existing SHP installations is evaluated. The model successfully identifies sites with high SHP potential into the basin headwaters,  together  with  thepower estimatesand the range of uncertainty due to satellite rainfall error. The model forms a useful basis for quantifying trade-offs between power and environmental impact of SHP portfolios.
