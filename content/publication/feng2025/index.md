abstract: "As one of the major forms of surface water bodies, rivers impact the well-being of humans and environmental health. In modern society and environment, rivers face planetary-scale stressors, making it more important than ever to monitor and understand them at the global scale. As the only synoptic resource for global primary data on rivers, satellite remote sensing provides unprecedented opportunities. Despite recent advances in its application, the role of satellite remote sensing in global river science is still not fully explored. New satellite systems and algorithms will allow substantial improvements in river measurements, enable new answers to long-standing or newly emerging science questions, and eventually advance global sciences. In this review, we will explore how remote sensing has been used to study global rivers, examine opportunities to further advance our understanding of rivers using existing and upcoming sensors, and identify remaining challenges and potential solutions."
