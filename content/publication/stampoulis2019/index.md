abstract: "Despite numerous advances in continental-scale hydrologic modeling
and improvements in global Land Surface Models, an accurate representation of
regional water table depth (WTD) remains a challenge. Data assimilation of
observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission
leads to improvements in the accuracy of hydrologic models, ultimately resulting
in more reliable estimates of lumped water storage. However, the usually shallow
groundwater compartment of many models presents a problem with GRACE
assimilation techniques, as these satellite observations also represent changes
in deeper soils and aquifers. To improve the accuracy of modeled groundwater
estimates and allow the representation of WTD at finer spatial scales, we
implemented a simple, yet novel approach to integrate GRACE data, by augmenting
the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. First, the subsurface
model structural representation was modified by incorporating an additional
(fourth) soil layer of varying depth (up to 1000 m) in VIC as the bottom
‘groundwater’ layer. This addition allows the model to reproduce water storage
variability not only in shallow soils but also in deeper groundwater, in order
to allow integration of the full GRACE-observed variability. Second, a Direct
Insertion scheme was developed that integrates the high temporal (daily) and
spatial (∼6.94 km) resolution model outputs to match the GRACE resolution,
performs the integration, and then disaggregates the updated model state after
the assimilation step. Simulations were performed with and without Direct
Insertion over the three largest river basins in California and including the
Central Valley, in order to test the augmented model's ability to capture
seasonal and inter-annual trends in the water table. This is the first-ever
fusion of GRACE total water storage change observations with hydrologic
simulations aiming at the determination of water table depth dynamics, at
spatial scales potentially useful for local water management."
