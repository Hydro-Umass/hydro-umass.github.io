abstract: "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms have rapidly developed as
tools for remote mapping at very high spatial resolutions. They have recently
gained in popularity in many application fields owing to the versatility of
platforms and sensors, ease of deployment, and a steady increase in
computational power. Obtaining highly detailed topography data over very small
scales is one of the more typical application domains. Here, we demonstrate this
application using Structure from Motion (SfM) processing over a small river
floodplain in Howard County (Maryland, USA). Evaluation of the derived
bare-earth terrain model with state-of-the art LiDAR shows a trivial bias of 1.6
cm and a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 39 cm. We then applied this
terrain model to extract floodplain and river cross-section geometries of a
small stream, important during high-magnitude urban flash flood events, with the
aim to assess its value for floodplain inundation mapping and first order
characterization of in-channel hydraulics. Initial findings agree with
traditional stream and floodplain classification theory and thus show very
promising results for this type of UAV usage. We expect this type of application
to gain more momentum in the near future with the ever-growing importance of
more detailed data in order to increase resilience to flood risk, especially in
urban areas."
summary: "We demonstrate the application of obtaining highly detailed topography
data over very small scales using Structure from Motion (SfM) processing over a small river
floodplain in Maryland."
