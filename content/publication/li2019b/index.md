abstract: "Based on a process‐level modeling of the rain‐on‐snow (ROS) events in
the period of 1950 to 2013 and in a warmer climate, we quantify the historical
and future runoff contribution from ROS to extreme floods and the source of
runoff and snowmelt in large ROS events within the conterminous United States
(CONUS). We find that the regions impacted most heavily by ROS include the West
Coast, the major mountain ranges of the western interior, the Upper Midwest, the
Northeast, and the lower Appalachians. While 70% of extreme (upper 0.1%) runoff
events in these regions have some contribution from ROS, the runoff generated
during these ROS events accounts for less than 10% of the total extreme flood
runoff; the much larger fraction of extreme runoff is from either intense
rainfall or clear‐sky snowmelt. Rainfall is the dominant source of runoff in ROS
events along the West Coast and over the west‐facing slopes of the Cascades and
Sierra Nevada, while snowmelt dominates ROS runoff in the other regions in the
CONUS. Net radiation dominates the snowmelt during ROS in the high mountains in
the West, while net radiation and turbulent heat flux are equally dominant in
the rest of CONUS. Historically, the role of ROS in streamflow extremes is most
significant in midelevation areas, but this “significant influence zone” will
shift to higher elevations in a warmer future. The future ROS frequency changes
exert a first order control on the future change of the runoff contribution from
ROS to extreme floods."
summary: "Through an analysis of long‐term rain-on-snow (ROS) and flood records over the conterminous United States, we evaluate the contribution of ROS to past flooding, and how ROS's contribution to floods will change in a warmer future."
