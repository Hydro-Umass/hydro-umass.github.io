Dr. Andreadis received his Engineering Degree (2002) from the Department of Environmental Engineering at the Technical University of Crete in Greece, and the M.Sc.E. (2004) and Ph.D. (2009) degrees from the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering University of Washington. After a 2-year post-doc at the Byrd Polar Research Center at the Ohio State University, he joined NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a Research Scientist. Dr. Andreadis’ research has primarily focused on the intersection between applied hydrologic modeling and remote sensing (visible and microwave), data assimilation, as well as the study of large-scale hydrology as it relates to climate change and environmental monitoring. In 2015 he was the recipient of the NASA Early Career Achievement Medal for his work in developing a framework for assimilating satellite and other datasets into land surface models.
