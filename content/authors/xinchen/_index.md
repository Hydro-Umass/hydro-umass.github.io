Xinchen He is pursuing a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. During his undergraduate study at the Hohai University, he was working on a national water pollution control project in Wuxi, China. His research has focused on applying both mechanistic and data driven models to simulate and predict algal blooms in rivers downstream of Taihu Lake. Currently, he aims to expand his research interests of ecohydrology to a more diverse area with the help of remote sensing and hydrological models.
