Urban encroachment on floodplains increases exposure and vulnerability to floods while population changes and climate change are expected to exacerbate those risks. Although the mechanisms of how urbanization affects flood risk are relatively well understood, there have been limited efforts in assessing the degree of floodplain encroachment globally and how it has changed both in space and time. With the advent of big-data geospatial processing tools, global-scale reconstructions of flood risk and changes in urban area have been made available and by combining these datasets, we can assess how floodplains have urbanized in relation to flood risk globally.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lake ecosystems</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/projects/lakes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/projects/lakes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Human acceleration of eutrophication through continued watershed and lakeshore development, combined with changes in temperature and climate, increasingly challenges managers to meet human needs while protecting aquatic resources. While annual winter water level drawdowns (WDs) are commonly used to reduce nuisance macrophyte biomass, the future utility and impacts to ecosystems under climate change remains uncertain. Moreover, the timing and magnitude of drawdowns, which are affected by climate, influences the negative impacts of drawdowns on lake water quality and food webs. Using remote sensing data, validated with on-the-ground water level and cyanobacteria data, we will characterize water level fluctuations and cyanobacteria blooms in WD lakes coupled to novel hydrologic models that assess sensitivity of these lakes to future climate and precipitation. The results from this research, which will be shared in scientific publications, will help evaluate WDs as a macrophyte management tool under future climate change and weigh any remaining benefits with the ecological and socioeconomic costs of performing WDs. This research is a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), University of Massachusetts Amherst, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and seven state agencies, who will provide in-kind support for collection of field data and translate results into guidance for lake managers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A data-driven framework to inform projections of aquatic flows in the Northeast</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/projects/foaf/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/projects/foaf/</guid><description>&lt;p>As climate change is impacting the future of aquatic flows, there is a great need for natural resource managers to assess adaptation measures in a holistic manner. The latter requires integrating multiple models with observational data, but that can be problematic due to disparities in terms of scale or fidelity of each model. Scientific machine learning, which has exploded in popularity in recent years, could provide a novel and flexible way of fusing observations and models. This project aims to develop a data-driven modeling framework that can help stakeholders incorporate the impacts of climate change into future predictions of aquatic flows. The proposed team will convene a working group composed of local, state and federal resource managers who are responsible for mitigating the impacts of climate change caused by extreme hydrologic events on fish and wildlife. Informed by this working group, the researchers will develop the data-driven framework by adopting modern computational methods that facilitate communication and ensure that the actual users of this framework are involved with its development from the ground up. The focus area of the proposed research will be the Northeast US, although the modeling tool is robust and can be applied within any region of the United States. Detailed user documentation and a simple interface will allow resource managers to incorporate the modeling tool into their existing workflow, making its adoption more likely. Data volumes are not getting any smaller, with more observations and model output becoming available to everyone. The overarching goal of this research is to bring in the very promising area of scientific maching learning into the hands of interested users and resource managers, ensuring fair access to such tools and demonstrating a different paradigm for climate change science.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
