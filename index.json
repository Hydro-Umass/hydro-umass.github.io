This study introduces a simplified framework for estimating soil physical and hydraulic properties crucial for managing agricultural water resources. The developed framework optimizes soil properties for the Regional Hydrological Extremes Assessment System (RHEAS) to enhance the performance of its core hydrological model, Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC). These soil properties were optimized using 6 years (2015-2021) of satellite soil moisture observations from NASA’s SMAP mission with a modified Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) optimization algorithm. A total of three most sensitive soil properties that controls model soil moisture simulations, such as Ksat (Saturated hydraulic conductivity), expt (exponent parameter in Campbell’s equation for hydraulic conductivity), and bd (Bulk density) were optimized for the study area. To better assess the impact of optimized soil properties, streamflow simulation as well as agricultural drought severity assessment were estimated using the RHEAS framework’s VIC Routing module and Soil Moisture Deficit Index (SMDI) module respectively. The streamflow simulation involved four approaches: an initial open-loop setup, one optimized with SMAP soil moisture data (SMAP), another optimized with actual streamflow data (Runoff), and a final one combining the previous two datasets (SMAP_Runoff). Switching from the initial setup to the SMAP-optimized model increased the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) by 56.4% and upgrading from the streamflow-optimized to the combined data model raised the NSE by 21.9%. This showcases the benefits of optimizing soil properties for more accurate simulations. Furthermore, the optimized model accurately represented the severity and extent of historical agricultural droughts, aligning with regional reports. This framework offers a valuable tool for hydrological modeling and drought management, particularly in data-scarce and agriculture-intensive regions informing agricultural water resource management, irrigation decision-making, and food security initiatives within the LMR Basin and beyond.","tags":null,"title":"Harnessing SMAP Satellite Soil Moisture Product to Optimize Soil Properties to Improve Water Resource Management for Agriculture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarath Suresh","Faisal Hossain","Sanchit Minocha","Pritam Das","Shahzaib Khan","Hyongki Lee","Kostas Andreadis","Perry Oddo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1712102400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712102400,"objectID":"c04814727bf6f40bc9d2f662156d08cd","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/suresh2024/","publishdate":"2024-04-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/suresh2024/","section":"publication","summary":"In parts of the world characterised by high precipitation and steep topography, hydroelectric dams often play the dual role of power generation and flood control. Improper and uncoordinated management of such dams during extreme and unexpected precipitation events can have disastrous consequences. As such, there exists a growing need for a reliable, transparent, and publicly available reservoir assessment and information system that can help water managers better prepare for such natural events. A fully satellite sensor-based framework offers a potentially viable approach towards this goal. The Reservoir Assessment Tool (RAT 3.0), which utilises high frequency remote sensing-based surface area and reservoir storage estimation alongside hydrological modelled inflow is tested and analysed for the 2018 Kerala floods in India. The effectiveness of RAT 3.0 was gauged by considering how well a fully satellite sensor-based framework was able to capture the rapidly evolving dynamics of the flood and reservoir state. Application of RAT 3.0 in monitoring the state of 19 reservoirs in Kerala during the flood event showed very promising results. In general, RAT 3.0 was found to be able to capture the temporal trend of the reservoir storage and pinpoint the sudden shift in filling or release decisions made by the dam operator with good accuracy. This translated to reliable updating of downstream flood risk in near real-time for improving flood preparedness, even though the absolute magnitudes were sometimes found to be in need of bias correction. A customised form of RAT 3.0 tailored for hydropower dams operating during high precipitation events in mountainous regions is proposed as an outcome of this study.","tags":null,"title":"Satellite-based Tracking of Reservoir Operations for Flood Management during the 2018 Extreme Weather Event in Kerala, India","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A paper from our collaboration with the Faisal Hossain’s group at the University of Washington has just been accepted for publication in the Environmental Modeling \u0026amp; Software journal.\nThe paper titled “ResORR: A Globally Scalable and Satellite Data-driven Algorithm for River Flow Regulation due to Reservoir Operations” describes a model that predicts regulated river flow from satellite observations.

Multi-sensor satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity to map and analyze drawdown frequency and metrics (timing, magnitude, duration) at broad scales. This study developed a cloud-computing framework to process time-series of synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel 1-SAR) and optical sensor (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2) data to characterize WD in 166 lakes across Massachusetts, USA from 2016‒2021. Comparison with in-situ logger data showed Sentinel-1 derived surface water area captured relative water level fluctuations indicative of WD. A machine learning approach classified lakes as WD versus non-WD based on seasonal water-level fluctuations derived from Sentinel 1-SAR data. The framework mapped WD lakes statewide, revealing prevalence throughout Massachusetts with interannual variability. Results showed WDs occurred in over 75% of lakes during the study period, with high interannual variability in number of lakes conducting WD. Mean WD magnitude was highest in the wettest year (2018) but % lake area exposure did not show any association with precipitation and varied between 8% to 12% over 5-year period. WD start date was later and duration was longer in wet, indicating climate mediation of WD implementation driven by management decisions. The data and tools developed provide an objective information resource to evaluate ecological impacts and guide management of this prevalent but understudied phenomenon. Overall, the results and interactive web tool developed under this study provide new hydrologic intelligence to inform water management and policies related to WD practices.","tags":null,"title":"A multi-sensor approach to characterize winter water level drawdown patterns in lakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kostas Andreadis","Dean Meason","Priscilla Corbett-Lad","Barbara Hock","Narendra Das"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1709164800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1709164800,"objectID":"93bfdde77a569b5e43ba3a19d0e4b60e","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/andreadis2024/","publishdate":"2024-02-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/andreadis2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Drought can have significant impacts on forests, with long periods of water scarcity leading to water stress in trees and possible damages to their eco-physiological functions. Satellite-based remote sensing offers a valuable tool for monitoring and assessing drought conditions over large and remote forested regions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the hydrological consistency in the context of drought of precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and land surface temperature observations against in-situ measurements in a number of well-monitored sites in New Zealand. Results showed that drought indicators were better captured from soil moisture observations compared to precipitation satellite observations. Nevertheless, we found statistically significant causality relationships between the multi-sensor satellite observations, with spatial resolution appearing to be an important aspect for the adequate estimation of drought characteristics. Understanding the limitations and capabilities of satellite observations is crucial for improving the accuracy of forest drought monitoring, which, in turn, will aid in sustainable forest management and the development of mitigation and adaptation strategies in the face of changing climate conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Hydrologic Consistency of Multi-Sensor Drought Observations in Forested Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Xinchen He who won an award for outstanding presentation!\nThe award was won for his presentation at the Northeast Aquatic Biologists Conference held February 14-16 in Fairlee, Vermont.\n","date":1707955200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707955200,"objectID":"ef2b09dc21fd34d4636c31ef6c63c91b","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/news/24-02-15-neab-award/","publishdate":"2024-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/24-02-15-neab-award/","section":"news","summary":"Congratulations to Xinchen He who won an award for outstanding presentation!\n","tags":null,"title":"Xinchen He wins student award at NAB conference","type":"news"},{"authors":["Andrew DelSanto","Richard Palmer","Kostas Andreadis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1706140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706140800,"objectID":"6e392198e919a5bfbdfe9939880d5bee","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/delsanto2024/","publishdate":"2024-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/delsanto2024/","section":"publication","summary":"In the northeast U.S., resource managers commonly apply 7-day, 10-year (7Q10) low flow estimates for protecting aquatic species in streams.

To generate the process-based estimates, the USGS's National Hydrologic Modeling (NHM-PRMS) framework (which relies on traditional rainfall-runoff modeling) is applied with 36 years of forcings from the Daymet climate dataset to a representative sample of ninety-four unimpaired gages in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. The rainfall-runoff models are calibrated to the measured streamflow at each gage using the recommended NHM-PRMS calibration procedure and evaluated using Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) for daily streamflow estimation. To evaluate the 7Q10 estimates made by the rainfall-runoff models compared to StreamStats, a multitude of error metrics are applied, including median relative bias (cfs/cfs), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (cfs), Relative RMSE (RRMSE) (cfs/cfs), and Unit-Area RMSE (UA-RMSE) (cfs/mi2). The calibrated rainfall-runoff models display both improved daily streamflow estimation (median KGE improving from 0.30 to 0.52) and 7Q10 estimation (smaller median relative bias, RMSE, RRMSE, and UA-RMSE, especially for basins larger than 100 mi2). The success of calibration is extended to ungaged locations using the machine learning algorithm Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, finding that traditional K-Means clustering (FCM clustering with no fuzzification factor) is the preferred method for model regionalization based on (1) Silhouette Analysis, (2) daily streamflow KGE, and (3) 7Q10 error metrics. The optimal rainfall-runoff models created with clustering show improvement for daily streamflow estimation (a median KGE of 0.48, only slightly below that of the calibrated models at 0.52); however, these models display similar error metrics for 7Q10 estimation compared to the uncalibrated models, neither of which provide improved error compared to the statistical estimates. Results suggest that the rainfall-runoff models calibrated to measured streamflow data provide the best 7Q10 estimation in terms of all error metrics except median relative bias, but for all models applicable to ungaged locations, the statistical estimates from StreamStats display the lowest error metrics in every category.","tags":null,"title":"Fuzzy C-Means clustering for physical model calibration and 7-day, 10-year low flow estimation in ungaged basins: comparisons to traditional, statistical estimates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lee Ellenburg","Sara Miller","Vikalp Mishra","Lilian Ndungu","Emily Adams","Narendra Das","Kostas Andreadis","Ashutosh Limaye"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1702252800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702252800,"objectID":"5032cd04f5105de12c53f2d10414fadf","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/ellenburg2023/","publishdate":"2023-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ellenburg2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Cropping system models can be used to both assess regional food security and to monitor and predict agricultural drought.

The goal of this study was to assess the ability of RHEAS to simulate the annual variability of maize yields at the county level across Kenya. Satellite derived datasets were used to evaluate the land surface component of the system and seasonally disaggregated yield for 5 years was used to assess the performance of the cropping system model. The median correlation between soil moisture from RHEAS-VIC and SMAP was 0.78 and the median correlation between RHEAS VIC-ET and  MODIS ET was 0.51, indicating that the model is able to capture the key drivers of the hydrological budget. Overall, RHEAS simulated yearly yield variations with a median correlation with reported yields of 0.7, with the best performance in the short rains season.  However, across both seasons, the RHEAS model was positively biased on the order of 1.5 MT/ha. The overall median unbiased RMSE was 0.5 MT/ha. The RHEAS system shows skill at simulating extreme departures in anomalies, and a majority of the time (62.5%) the reported yields fall within the interquartile range of the simulations.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of a regional crop model implementation for sub-national yield assessments in Kenya","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pritam Das","Faisal Hossain","Sanchit Minocha","George Darkwah","Hyongki Lee","Kostas Andreadis","Miguel Laverde","Perry Oddo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1699574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699574400,"objectID":"c2d29d7c53a767c77eead294438c2c9e","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/das2024/","publishdate":"2023-11-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/das2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Storage and release of surface water by reservoirs can alter the natural streamflow pattern of rivers with negative impacts on the environment. Such reservoir-driven river regulation is poorly understood at a global scale due to a lack of publicly available in-situ data on reservoir operations. However, with rapid advancements in satellite remote sensing-based tracking of reservoir state, this gap in data availability can be bridged. In this study, we modeled regulated flow of rivers using only satellite-observed reservoir state and hydrological modeling forced also with satellite precipitation data. We propose a globally scalable algorithm, ResORR (Reservoir Operations driven River Regulation), to predict regulated river flow and tested it over the heavily regulated basin of the Cumberland River in the US. ResORR was found able to model regulated river flow due to upstream reservoir operations of the Cumberland river. Over a mountainous basin dominated by high rainfall, ResORR was effective in capturing extreme flooding modified by upstream hydropower dam operations. ResORR successfully captured the peak of the regulated river flow altered by hydropower dam and flood control operations during the devastating floods of 2018 in the South Indian state of Kerala. On an average, ResORR improved regulation river flow simulation by more than 50% across all performance metrics when compared to hydrologic model without a regulation module. ResORR is a timely algorithm for understanding human regulation of surface water as satellite-estimated reservoir state is expected to improve globally with the recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.","tags":null,"title":"ResORR: A Globally Scalable and Satellite Data-driven Algorithm for River Flow Regulation due to Reservoir Operations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xinchen He","Kostas Andreadis","Allison Roy","Abhishek Kumar","Caitlyn Butler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698796800,"objectID":"97a6034c9f990f43471e3d1dd65bb054","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/he2023/","publishdate":"2023-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/he2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Winter drawdown (WD) is a common lake management tool for multiple purposes such as flood control, aquatic vegetation reduction, and lake infrastructure maintenance. To minimize adverse impacts to a lake's ecosystem, regulatory agencies may provide managers with general guidelines for drawdown and refill timing, drawdown magnitude, and outflow limitations. However, there is significant uncertainty associated with the potential to meet management targets due to variability in lake characteristics and hydrometeorology of each lake's basin, making the use of modeling tools a necessity. In this context, we developed a hydrological modeling framework for lake water level drawdown management (HMF-Lake) and evaluated it at 15 Massachusetts lakes where WDs have been applied over multiple years for vegetation control. HMF-Lake is based on the daily lake water balance, with inflows simulated by a lumped rainfall-runoff model (Cemaneige-GR4J) and outflow/release rate calculated by a modified Target Storage and Release Based Method (TSRB). The model showed a satisfactory performance of simulating historical water levels (0.53 \u003c NSE \u003c 0.86); However, uncertainties from meteorological inputs and TSRB determined lake outflow rate affected the result accuracy. To account for these uncertainties, the model was executed stochastically to assess the ability of study lakes to follow the state general WD guidelines: drawdown by Dec 1 and fully refilled by Apr 1. By using the stochastic HMF-Lake, the probabilities of each lake to reach the drawdown level by Dec 1 were calculated for different drawdown magnitudes (1 - 6 ft). Moreover, we employed the stochastic model to derive the annual latest refill starting dates that ensure a 95% probability of reaching the normal water level by April 1. These results provide lake managers with a quantitative understanding of the lake's ability to follow the state guidelines. The model may be used to systematically evaluate current WD management strategies at state or regional scales and support adaptive WD management under changing climates.","tags":null,"title":"Developing a stochastic hydrological model for informing lake water level drawdown management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhijeet Abhishek","Mantha Phanikumar","Alicia Sendrowski","Kostas Andreadis","Mahya Hashemi","Susantha Jayasinghe","Vara Prasad","Robert Brent","Narendra Das"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":169344e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":169344e4,"objectID":"7d3f1f97627ba4374f15ae3d672e0a10","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/abhishek2023/","publishdate":"2023-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/abhishek2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Crop yield predictions on an inter-seasonal to inter-annual horizon are subject to a diverse set of uncertainties associated with climate forecast scenarios.

As dams continue to proliferate, monitoring water availability influenced by reservoir operations is now of paramount importance. The Reservoir Assessment Tool (RAT) is a data-driven software that integrates satellite remote sensing with hydrological models, enabling the estimation of key reservoir parameters such as inflow, outflow, surface area, evaporation and storage changes. The earliest rendition of RAT (version 1.0) was set up for 1598 reservoirs around the world with limitations in functional robustness, updating frequency and scalability. Some of these limitations on updating frequency and functional robustness were addressed in version 2.0 that was later made operational for the inter-governmental agency of the Mekong River Commission. Recognizing the need for scalability to mobilize the global water management community to benefit from satellite remote sensing, we hereby introduce RAT version 3.0. This version is optimized for accelerating open collaboration among users for continuous improvement and customization of RAT to enable reservoir management breakthroughs. RAT 3.0 represents a wholesale overhaul from the previous versions to empower the global community of users and developers in the spirit of the open-source movement. RAT 3.0 allows reservoir monitoring advancements and new functional developments that can be freely exchanged and seamlessly integrated for continuous evolution of the software. A centralized web application has also been established to facilitate the storage and dissemination of global reservoir monitoring information along with comprehensive training resources. RAT 3.0 aspires to usher the traditional water management community into the era of satellite remote sensing. The global impact of the software can be expected to increase as uptake spreads, enabling a more sustainable and equitable utilization of our planet's water resources.","tags":null,"title":"Reservoir Assessment Tool Version 3.0: A Scalable and User-Friendly Software Platform to Mobilize the Global Water Management Community","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Md Abul Ehsan Bhuiyan","Alexander Roper","Kostas Andreadis","Richard Palmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675123200,"objectID":"7fbdf7d7d45c10ca81b3aa8438fc23dc","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/bhuiyan2023/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bhuiyan2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Forecasting municipal water demands is an essential requirement of long-term water supply planning, seasonal operations, and daily management. Long-term water demand forecasting is challenged by changes in water pricing, conservation, overall shifts in per capita consumption and changes in climate. Traditional parametric approaches have proven useful although these have often resulted in significant overestimations of demand. This paper presents an approach that applies a Random Forest (RF) machine learning technique to a variety of physical, climate, and economic variables to improve the water demand forecasts. This method, denoted as the “Random Forest Water Demand Forecasting (RF-WDF) framework,” is applied to twelve utilities throughout the US over the period of 2004-2018. For the RF optimization, a randomized search cross validation (RandomizedSearchCV) process is employed to obtain optimal hyperparameters and avoid overfitting. The RF-WDF is evaluated using repeated random holdout, and leave-one-year-out experiments, separately in each region. The water demand forecasts generated by the RF-WDF show improvements by producing high linear correlation (0.71-0.91) and Kling-Gupta Efficiency values (0.72-0.94) for the twelve cities. In applying this technique to cities with water demands that vary significantly, the magnitude of systematic and random error for the RF-WDF generated water demand was noticeably decreased (by 2-10%) compared to more traditional approaches. Finally, a k-fold cross-validation experiment was conducted to examine the transferability of the RF-WDF framework for 12 US Utilities. We conclude that the proposed RF-WDF ensemble framework has the potential to improve the skill in demand forecasts which could directly benefit water resources planning and management.","tags":null,"title":"Forecasting Summer Water Demand Using Optimized Random Forests: A Case Study of 12 US Utilities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mahya Hashemi","Abhijeet Abhishek","Ehsan Jalilvand","Susantha Jayasinghe","Kostas Andreadis","Narendra Das"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667260800,"objectID":"e2336a2421cba81b38d8837bfa4b6558","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/hashemi2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hashemi2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Planting date (PD) is one of the critical component in crop modeling that has a large-scale impact on seasonal yield estimation. Here, we aimed to estimate the various paddy/rice attributes (particularly, acreage and PD) using the Sentinel-1A observations, and assessing the impact of such key parameters on end-of-season yields. The method comprises: (1) a multi-temporal time-series analysis algorithm of Sentinel-1A observations for rice mapping, (2) a PD retrieval algorithm, and (3) rice yield estimation using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-derived PD in a modeling system. Our study was implemented over the rainfed paddy fields in Cambodia be-tween 2017 thru 2020. We demonstrated that the backscatter ratio (sigma VH 0 sigma VV 0) from Sentinel-1A can improve the accuracy of rice mapping, while sigma VH0 backscatter can provide PD estimations. Our results showcased reasonable/ good performance in mapping the paddy fields and estimating PD in the study area. PD found in March and April were indicative of irrigation application in some parts of Cambodia, specifically in the southeastern part (also part of the Mekong delta) where irrigation in paddy fields is a common practice. Differences between the crop -calendar based PD (June 1) and the SAR-derived PD can range as much as 75 days. In the rice-dominated provinces such as Banteay-Meanchey and Svay-Rieng of Cambodia, when SAR-derived PD are used, rice yield normalized bias improved compared to the fixed PD data by a mean of 7-12 % and 30-48 % respectively within the study period. In addition, the PD derived from SAR also significantly reduced the uncertainty in yield esti-mation.

Highly resolved global datasets of both flood risk and changes in urban area from 1985-2015 are now available, enabling the reconstruction of the history of floodplain encroachment at high spatial resolutions. Here we show that the urbanized area in floodplains that have an average probability of flooding of 1/100 years, has almost doubled since 1985. Further, the rate of urban expansion into these floodplains increased by a factor of 1.5 after the year 2000. We also find that urbanization rates were highest in the most hazardous areas of floodplains, with population growth in these urban floodplains suggesting an accompanying increase in population density.

In this study, we evaluated the ability of the three SMAP products to estimate the magnitude and dynamics of soil moisture in a relatively challenging environment of dense forest cover and topographic complexity using ground measurements from seven sites in New Zealand. We found that the finer-scale products had an overall smaller error and higher correlations when compared with the ground measurements, but did exhibit noise especially as canopy closure increased. On the other hand, the 9-km product had larger errors but was still able to capture the temporal dynamics of soil moisture.

We assessed the performance across different geographical locations and climatic conditions around the globe. Also, in terms of extreme precipitation and hydrological utility. Asia, and in particular China, concentrates the largest number of IMERG evaluation studies on the continental and country level. The performance of IMERG varies with seasons, precipitation type, structure, and intensities. IMERG is shown to appropriately estimate and detect regional precipitation patterns, and their spatial mean. There is sufficient room to improve its performance over mountainous regions characterized by orographic precipitation, complex terrains, and winter precipitation. Furthermore, despite IMERG's better performance compared to other satellite products in reproducing spatio-temporal patterns and variability of extreme precipitation, some studies present limitations surrounding the intensity of precipitation, showing significant under- and overestimation. In terms of temporal performance, at the seasonal scale, IMERG behaves poorly in winter, whereas the performances at monthly and annual scale were reasonably better than the daily and sub-daily scale. However, we also report very few sub-daily studies, particularly at 30-min scale. Finally, in terms of hydrological application, the use of IMERG has resulted in significant discrepancies in the simulation of streamflow.

Here, the authors present a parameterized geospatial and machine learning dam hazard potential classification model to overcome these limitations. The parameters of this model can be tuned for optimal performance. However, for this classification problem, the regulatory and physical implications of the types of model misclassifications are best captured through multiple objectives. Therefore, this research additionally contributes a novel multi-objective approach to machine learning hyperparameter tuning. This research demonstrates the utility of this approach for dams in Massachusetts, United States using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to explore different model parameterizations and identify analyst-relevant tradeoffs among objectives describing model performance. Such an approach allows for greater justification of model parameters as well as greater insights into the complexities of the dam hazard potential classification problem.","tags":null,"title":"Screening Tool for Dam Hazard Potential Classification Using Machine Learning and Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Tuning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Papalexiou","Chandra Rajulapati","Kostas Andreadis","Efi Foufoula-Georgiou","Martyn Clark","Kevin Trenberth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1632528e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632528e3,"objectID":"71ed17b779acf642566853fda7096854","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/papalexiou2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/papalexiou2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Droughs have widespread social and ecological impacts and thus it is critical to develop long-term adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce drought vulnerability.

We implemented a comprehensive drought and crop yield information system, the Regional Hydrologic Extremes Assessment System (RHEAS) that couples a core hydrologic model with a crop growth model, over Cambodia in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) to capture the subtle, intrinsic nature of drought, and assess the impact on inter-seasonal and intra- annual rice yields. Simulations based on RHEAS show good agreement with observations (R2 ~ 0.8). A regional scale assessment over Cambodia was carried out to examine linkages between rice productivity and meteorological/hydrologic drought variability from 2000-2016. Using standardized indices of drought and other indicators of meteorological, agricultural, and hydrologic drought, the onset and prevalence of dry and wet periods were examined at multiple temporal scales. The temporal variability in drought intensity exhibited higher stress, indicating mild to severe dry conditions, during the initial months (Mar-May). However, the onset of monsoon at the beginning of the planting season (June) resulted in the prevalence of normal to moderate wet conditions. A linear trend analysis for the period 2000 - 2016 showed a consistent increase (2900 kg/ha in 2000 to 3550 kg/ha in 2016) in rice yields, though drought- stricken provinces showed lower yields throughout the study period. Overall, a continuous increase in annual rice yields irrespective of the stress conditions was noted with no clear pattern linking drought parameters with crop yields on a regional scale. The application of chemical-based fertilizers has steadily increased over the years since 2008 and the consistent increase in rice yields correlated (R2=0.84) with increased fertilizer use. Information from the hydrologic and crop model components within RHEAS enables development of critical regional and local thresholds, reflecting the increasing levels of risk and vulnerability towards drought.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating the impacts of drought on rice productivity over Cambodia in the Lower Mekong Basin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Renato Frasson","Michael Durand","Kevin Larnier","Colin Gleason","Kostas Andreadis","Craig Brinkerhoff"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1624233600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624233600,"objectID":"9042d92733cddf16907f64a1ff4c1566","permalink":"https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/frasson2021/","publishdate":"2021-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frasson2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Openly available measurements of river flow are essential to allocation of water resources, flood and drought forecast and mitigation efforts, for our understanding of the hydrologic cycle and for many other applications.

Measurements taken from satellite missions such as upcoming the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission offer data that can be freely downloaded by anyone; however, such platforms often measure either water level or inundated areas and how they change over time, which are not sufficient to directly quantify river flow. Methods to estimate discharge based on satellite measurements have been or are in development and knowledge of the uncertainty of their estimates is essential for wide application of such methods. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy and precision of five methods designed to estimate discharge based on SWOT measurements under three conditions: ideal, that is if the measurements were available once a day and contained no error, with no measurement error but changing how frequently the measurements were taken, and a third scenario containing different levels of measurement error. We found that the precision of the estimates is related to the precision in the prior guess of the mean annual flow rate. However, the assessed methods consistently improved over the prior, especially when reach where the methods operate have distinct characteristics in space. We also found that despite the use of very similar discharge equations, the subtle differences in equations among the methods can be important.

However, McFLI currently suffers from two major drawbacks: 1) Existing optical satellites lead to temporally and spatially sparse discharge estimates, and 2) because of the assumptions required, McFLI cannot guarantee downstream flow continuity. Hydrological modeling has neither drawback, yet model accuracy is frequently limited by a lack of discharge observations. We therefore combine McFLI and models in a data assimilation framework applicable globally. We establish a daily “ungauged” baseline model for 28,998 reaches of the Missouri river basin forced by recently published global runoff data, which we do not calibrate. We estimate discharge via McFLI using ~1 million width measurements made from 12,000 Landsat scenes and assimilate McFLI into the model before validating at 403 USGS gauges. Results show that assimilated discharges did not impair already accurate baseline flows and achieved median improvements of 28% Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), 0.50 Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and 0.23 Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) where baseline performance was poor (defined as baseline negative NSE, 225/403 reaches). We ultimately improved flows at 92% of these originally poorly modelled gauges, even though Landsat images only provide McFLI discharges at 1.5% of reaches and 26% of simulated days.

Ensemble methods are largely preferred as they enable the estimation of error properties, but at the expense of computational load and generally with underestimations. These imperfect stochastic estimates motivate the use of correction methods, that is, error localization and inflation, although the physical justifications for their optimality are limited. The purpose of this study is to use one of the simplest forms of data assimilation when applied to river modeling and reveal the underlying mechanisms impacting its performance. Our framework based on assimilating daily averaged in situ discharge measurements to correct daily averaged runoff was tested over a 4-yr case study of two rivers in Texas. Results show that under optimal conditions of inflation and localization, discharge simulations are consistently improved such that the mean values of Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency are enhanced from −11.32 to 0.55 at observed gauges and from −12.24 to −1.10 at validation gauges. Yet, parameters controlling the inflation and the localization have a large impact on the performance. Further investigations of these sensitivities showed that optimal inflation occurs when compensating exactly for discrepancies in the magnitude of errors while optimal localization matches the distance traveled during one assimilation window. These results may be applicable to more advanced data assimilation methods as well as for larger applications motivated by upcoming river-observing satellite missions, such as NASA’s Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission.","tags":null,"title":"Underlying Fundamentals of Kalman Filtering for River Network Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kostas Andreadis"],"categories":null,"content":"I’m teaching a class on computational methods for environmental engineers this semester, and the language of choice is Python\nas it is simple enough for potentially novice programmers and has a very rich ecosystem of existing libraries that make life easier for any environmental engineer/scientist.

The other aspect of the class that I found tremendously useful was live coding. Thankfully, the RISE extension combines Jupyter notebooks with slideshows (powered by Reveal.js presentation framework) and I ended up using it exclusively for preparing the lectures.\nAlthough a good chunk of the class was spent with the students coding on their own with me going around answering questions, I decided to take it a step further by utilizing a flipped classroom approach and combining it with paired/grouped learning. Essentially the students go over some lecture material prior to class, and we spend most of the lecture time explaining anything that the students had trouble but leave enough time for groups of students to solve a coding problem (relevant to the lecture material of course). The last part of the lecture is spent going over the answers of each student group and answering any questions. This presents a technology issue: it would be too much of a hassle to connect each student’s laptop to the projector in order to show their answers to the entire class. The answer would be to set up a server where the students can connect and solve the problem in Jupyter notebooks on the server. Jupyter Hub would be the solution, but I didn’t want to have all the students connect to my laptop.\nHere’s where the the Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH) comes in, which is a distribution that helps you provide Jupyter Notebooks to 1-50 users on a single server (hosted on a cloud provider potentially). In this post, I will document how I set up TLJH on the Google Cloud.\nThe first step involves logging in to the Google Cloud Console and creating a new VM instance.

Data assimilation of observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission leads to improvements in the accuracy of hydrologic models, ultimately resulting in more reliable estimates of lumped water storage. However, the usually shallow groundwater compartment of many models presents a problem with GRACE assimilation techniques, as these satellite observations also represent changes in deeper soils and aquifers. To improve the accuracy of modeled groundwater estimates and allow the representation of WTD at finer spatial scales, we implemented a simple, yet novel approach to integrate GRACE data, by augmenting the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. First, the subsurface model structural representation was modified by incorporating an additional (fourth) soil layer of varying depth (up to 1000 m) in VIC as the bottom ‘groundwater’ layer. This addition allows the model to reproduce water storage variability not only in shallow soils but also in deeper groundwater, in order to allow integration of the full GRACE-observed variability. Second, a Direct Insertion scheme was developed that integrates the high temporal (daily) and spatial (∼6.94 km) resolution model outputs to match the GRACE resolution, performs the integration, and then disaggregates the updated model state after the assimilation step. Simulations were performed with and without Direct Insertion over the three largest river basins in California and including the Central Valley, in order to test the augmented model's ability to capture seasonal and inter-annual trends in the water table.

The early season forecasts on 1 February provide valuable lead time for mitigating the impact of drought. In both experiments, initializing the ESP with the reanalysis SWE reduced the seasonal streamflow forecast errors; compared with existing operational statistical forecasts, the peak-annual SWE insertion and the 1 February SWE insertion reduced the overall root-mean-square error of the seasonal streamflow forecasts by 13% and 23%, respectively, over the 13 major rivers draining the Sierra Nevada.

DA also improved SWE percent difference over theUncompahgre basin (284% open loop,265% DA) and Olympic Peninsula (26% open loop,20.2% DA).However, in anomalously wet years DA underestimates SWE, likely due to an inadequate snow depletioncurve parameterization. Despite potential shortcomings due to VIC model setup (e.g., water balance mode)or parameterization (snow depletion curve), the DA framework implemented in this study shows promise inovercoming some of these limitations and improving estimated SWE, in particular during drier years or athigher elevations, when most in situ observations cannot capture high-elevation snowpack due to lack ofstations there.","tags":null,"title":"A High-Resolution Data Assimilation Framework for Snow Water EquivalentEstimation across the Western United States and Validation with theAirborne Snow Observatory","type":"publication"}]
