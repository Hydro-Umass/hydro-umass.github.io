Rain-on-snow floods, in some cases amplified by frozen soils, have been responsible for some of the largest recorded floods in the West, as well as the North Central
States and the Northeast. Despite their importance snowpacks remain poorly quantified (especially, but not only, in topographically complex regions), leaving hydrological models such as the &lt;a href="https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Water Model&lt;/a> (NWM) poorly constrained with significant uncertainty in both their physical and statistical parameterizations. Remote sensing can alleviate some of these limitations and recently-produced datasets from optical satellite sensors have provided long-term and high-resolution maps of snow water equivalent (SWE). In this project, we will extend a satellite-derived SWE reanalysis (from Landsat, MODIS, and VIIRS) over the Continental United States (CONUS) and assess the representation of SWE in the NWM. Apart from directly evaluating the output of the NWM in terms of SWE, we will diagnose model errors and characterize them both statistically as well as in terms of the model parameterizations. The results from the diagnostic and sensitivity analyses will be used to derive error models and improved parameterizations for NWM that will be tested and compared with the baseline NWM version.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lake ecosystems</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/lakes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/lakes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Human acceleration of eutrophication through continued watershed and lakeshore development, combined with changes in temperature and climate, increasingly challenges managers to meet human needs while protecting aquatic resources. While annual winter water level drawdowns (WDs) are commonly used to reduce nuisance macrophyte biomass, the future utility and impacts to ecosystems under climate change remains uncertain. Moreover, the timing and magnitude of drawdowns, which are affected by climate, influences the negative impacts of drawdowns on lake water quality and food webs. Using remote sensing data, validated with on-the-ground water level and cyanobacteria data, we will characterize water level fluctuations and cyanobacteria blooms in WD lakes coupled to novel hydrologic models that assess sensitivity of these lakes to future climate and precipitation. The results from this research, which will be shared in scientific publications, will help evaluate WDs as a macrophyte management tool under future climate change and weigh any remaining benefits with the ecological and socioeconomic costs of performing WDs. This research is a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), University of Massachusetts Amherst, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and seven state agencies, who will provide in-kind support for collection of field data and translate results into guidance for lake managers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Urbanization and flooding</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/flooding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/flooding/</guid><description>&lt;p>Floods are one of the costliest natural disasters both in terms of
damages and human livelihood losses. Urban encroachment on
floodplains increases exposure and vulnerability to floods while
population changes and climate change are expected to exacerbate
those risks. Although
the mechanisms of how urbanization affects flood risk are relatively
well understood, there have been limited efforts in assessing the
degree of floodplain encroachment globally and how it has changed
both in space and time. With the advent of big-data geospatial
processing tools, global-scale reconstructions of flood risk and
changes in urban area have been made available and by combining
these datasets, we can assess how floodplains have urbanized in
relation to flood risk globally.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
