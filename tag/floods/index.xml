damages and human livelihood losses. Urban encroachment on
floodplains increases exposure and vulnerability to floods while
population changes and climate change are expected to exacerbate
those risks. Although
the mechanisms of how urbanization affects flood risk are relatively
well understood, there have been limited efforts in assessing the
degree of floodplain encroachment globally and how it has changed
both in space and time. With the advent of big-data geospatial
processing tools, global-scale reconstructions of flood risk and
changes in urban area have been made available and by combining
these datasets, we can assess how floodplains have urbanized in
relation to flood risk globally.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
