The latter requires integrating multiple models with observational data, but that can be problematic due to disparities in terms of scale or fidelity of each model. Scientific machine learning, which has exploded in popularity in recent years, could provide a novel and flexible way of fusing observations and models. This project aims to develop a data-driven modeling framework that can help stakeholders incorporate the impacts of climate change into future predictions of aquatic flows. The proposed team will convene a working group composed of local, state and federal resource managers who are responsible for mitigating the impacts of climate change caused by extreme hydrologic events on fish and wildlife. Informed by this working group, the researchers will develop the data-driven framework by adopting modern computational methods that facilitate communication and ensure that the actual users of this framework are involved with its development from the ground up. The focus area of the proposed research will be the Northeast US, although the modeling tool is robust and can be applied within any region of the United States. Detailed user documentation and a simple interface will allow resource managers to incorporate the modeling tool into their existing workflow, making its adoption more likely. Data volumes are not getting any smaller, with more observations and model output becoming available to everyone. The overarching goal of this research is to bring in the very promising area of scientific maching learning into the hands of interested users and resource managers, ensuring fair access to such tools and demonstrating a different paradigm for climate change science.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Developing a global assimilation and modeling framework to produce SWOT data products</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/swot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/swot/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWOT satellite mission&lt;/a> will observe water surface elevation, slope, storage change (directly) and river discharge (indirectly) globally at unprecedented spatial resolutions and accuracies, potentially having a “transformational impact in terrestrial hydrology”. Although the SWOT data products of the aforementioned variables will be tremendously valuable they can be enhanced by combining with hydrologic and hydrodynamic models. In fact, there have been a few studies that have examined the value of assimilating SWOT observations into hydrodynamic models to estimate river discharge or channel bathymetry. The primary advantage of using a data assimilation approach is the estimation of continuous fields of the SWOT-observed variables in both space and time. Moreover, data assimilation can be used to infer other variables (e.g. runoff) or optimize model parameters by accounting for model and observation errors. With this project we are developing a modeling and assimilation framework specifically for SWOT observations that could be used to generate Level 4 data products.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Evaluation and diagnosis of the National Water Model snow simulations</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/nwm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/nwm/</guid><description>&lt;p>Snow accumulation and its melt dominate water resources in mountainous areas, with regions such as the western United States deriving more than 75% of the total freshwater available annually from snowmelt. Rain-on-snow floods, in some cases amplified by frozen soils, have been responsible for some of the largest recorded floods in the West, as well as the North Central
States and the Northeast. Despite their importance snowpacks remain poorly quantified (especially, but not only, in topographically complex regions), leaving hydrological models such as the &lt;a href="https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Water Model&lt;/a> (NWM) poorly constrained with significant uncertainty in both their physical and statistical parameterizations. Remote sensing can alleviate some of these limitations and recently-produced datasets from optical satellite sensors have provided long-term and high-resolution maps of snow water equivalent (SWE). In this project, we will extend a satellite-derived SWE reanalysis (from Landsat, MODIS, and VIIRS) over the Continental United States (CONUS) and assess the representation of SWE in the NWM. Apart from directly evaluating the output of the NWM in terms of SWE, we will diagnose model errors and characterize them both statistically as well as in terms of the model parameterizations. The results from the diagnostic and sensitivity analyses will be used to derive error models and improved parameterizations for NWM that will be tested and compared with the baseline NWM version.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monitoring and forecasting drought and crop yield for the Lower Mekong Basin</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/servir/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/servir/</guid><description>&lt;p>Rice is Asia’s most important food crop with nearly 3 billion people reliant on rice as their major food source. Over the next ten years this number is expected to climb to nearly 4 billion people. Throughout Southeast Asia, the most important constraint to rice production is water stress, which affects nearly 10 million ha of upland rice and over 13 million ha of rain-fed lowland rice. Future climate change effects on rainfall timing and amount, and projected increases in temperature are expected to exacerbate existing water stresses and will have a direct impact on agriculture, especially rice cultivation. In a project funded by NASA and USAID through the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/servir/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SERVIR program&lt;/a>, we are providing the SERVIR-Mekong hub with the modeling and data system tools needed to produce linked hydrologic and crop yield as nowcasts, forecasts and at climate scales using the best available data including NASA Earth observations. The effort aims to “improve, enrich, and expand the use of Earth observations” to help make informed decisions in order to adapt to and reduce vulnerabilities from impacts of extreme events and future climate change in the Lower Mekong.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lake ecosystems</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/lakes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/lakes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Human acceleration of eutrophication through continued watershed and lakeshore development, combined with changes in temperature and climate, increasingly challenges managers to meet human needs while protecting aquatic resources. While annual winter water level drawdowns (WDs) are commonly used to reduce nuisance macrophyte biomass, the future utility and impacts to ecosystems under climate change remains uncertain. Moreover, the timing and magnitude of drawdowns, which are affected by climate, influences the negative impacts of drawdowns on lake water quality and food webs. Using remote sensing data, validated with on-the-ground water level and cyanobacteria data, we will characterize water level fluctuations and cyanobacteria blooms in WD lakes coupled to novel hydrologic models that assess sensitivity of these lakes to future climate and precipitation. The results from this research, which will be shared in scientific publications, will help evaluate WDs as a macrophyte management tool under future climate change and weigh any remaining benefits with the ecological and socioeconomic costs of performing WDs. This research is a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), University of Massachusetts Amherst, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and seven state agencies, who will provide in-kind support for collection of field data and translate results into guidance for lake managers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Urbanization and flooding</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/flooding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/project/flooding/</guid><description>&lt;p>Floods are one of the costliest natural disasters both in terms of
damages and human livelihood losses. Urban encroachment on
floodplains increases exposure and vulnerability to floods while
population changes and climate change are expected to exacerbate
those risks. Although
the mechanisms of how urbanization affects flood risk are relatively
well understood, there have been limited efforts in assessing the
degree of floodplain encroachment globally and how it has changed
both in space and time. With the advent of big-data geospatial
processing tools, global-scale reconstructions of flood risk and
changes in urban area have been made available and by combining
these datasets, we can assess how floodplains have urbanized in
relation to flood risk globally.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
