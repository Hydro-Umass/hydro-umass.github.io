&lt;p>The paper titled &amp;ldquo;ResORR: A Globally Scalable and Satellite Data-driven Algorithm for River Flow Regulation due to Reservoir Operations&amp;rdquo; describes a model that predicts regulated river flow from satellite observations. ResORR now has its own &lt;a href="https://github.com/UW-SASWE/ResORR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software home and documentation&lt;/a> page and is integrated into the RAT 3.0
(reservoir assessment tool) package. As reservoir storage change and diversion estimates improve steadily over time in the era of SWOT, we expect ResORR to become a standard post processing plugin to help RAT users improve their understanding of human regulation of surface water through reservoir operations. In addition ResORR stands on its own for use with other hydrologic models or streamflow models in regulated river basins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Xinchen He wins student award at NAB conference</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/news/24-02-15-neab-award/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/news/24-02-15-neab-award/</guid><description>&lt;p>Congratulations to Xinchen He who won an award for outstanding presentation!&lt;/p>
