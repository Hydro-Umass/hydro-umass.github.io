She received her Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s from the Department of Water Resources Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Bangladesh and worked as a Water Resources Engineer after that. She was also involved in research work from her undergrad and built a few hydrodynamic-morphological models for a flashy river in her country, worked with remote sensing and flood forecasting using machine learning. Her research interests are a blend of remote sensing, numerical modelling, and machine learning. She is deeply passionate about harnessing the power of data-driven methodologies to find sustainable and innovative solutions in the fields of water resource engineering and climate change.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
