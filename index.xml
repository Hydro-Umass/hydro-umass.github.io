Global coverage and often sun-synchronous orbits provide a seemingly uniform view of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. However, atmospheric conditions vary both regionally and seasonally. For example, the central section of the Amazon basin, the world’s largest river by discharge, typically experiences more than 90% cloud cover during the wet season. This period is arguably the most important to monitor for hydrological study and could be entirely unobserved when relying on satellite optical remote sensing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rapidly increasing spatial and temporal resolution of satellite sensors has increased the volume of available cloud-free optical data, but with daily high-resolution imagery now available, we are nearing a barrier that cannot be circumvented by better optical sensors alone. Kostas and I, along with co-author George Allen, recently submitted a manuscript to Geophysical Research Letters that characterizes the global impact of clouds on remote sensing observations of rivers. We analyzed 22 years of daily river discharge and cloud data covering 21,642 sections of rivers of various sizes and climates. Our findings reveal that cloud cover severely biases the distribution of river discharges we observe, especially for Tropical and Arctic rivers. This means that &lt;strong>satellite images do not accurately represent river conditions&lt;/strong>. Our research provides the first comprehensive analysis of extent and impact of this bias.&lt;/p>

&lt;em>In this figure, the color scale from red to blue indicates the amount of bias in the median river discharge when sampled only on cloud-free days. Negative bias (red) indicates that optical satellites underestimate the median discharge. We found that the severity and direction of this bias can be predicted by the relationship between cloud and discharge seasonality (see subplots above and below map).&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

First, we followed the &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL095614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 GRL paper&lt;/a> to use Landsat to retrieve long-term lake ice cover data for &amp;gt;33,000 lakes in the Northern Hemisphere (1985-2022). While Landsat can provide high-resolution (30m) observations on a global scale, the relative long revisiting period (~16 days) and influences from the cloud cover may result in large data gaps and potential incorrect estimates of the ice duration. In order to address these limitations, we trained a deep learning model: Long Short-Term Memory with the satellite observations from 1985-2012 (Landsat 5 &amp;amp; 7) to predict the daily lake ice cover using the &lt;a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERA5-Land&lt;/a> daily meteorological data (e.g. air temperature) and static attributes from &lt;a href="https://www.hydrosheds.org/products/hydrolakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HydroLAKES&lt;/a> (e.g. depth) as input.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We evaluated the model against the satellite observations during the test period (2013-2022, Landsat 8 &amp;amp; 9) to examine the ability of the model to predict future lake ice. The performance was satisfactory during the test period with a median Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.10 (Ice cover ranges from 0 to 1). Note the model has not seen the test data during training, this indicates a strong potential to apply the model to run future projections of lake ice.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The paper titled &amp;ldquo;ResORR: A Globally Scalable and Satellite Data-driven Algorithm for River Flow Regulation due to Reservoir Operations&amp;rdquo; describes a model that predicts regulated river flow from satellite observations.

As reservoir storage change and diversion estimates improve steadily over time in the era of SWOT, we expect ResORR to become a standard post processing plugin to help RAT users improve their understanding of human regulation of surface water through reservoir operations. In addition ResORR stands on its own for use with other hydrologic models or streamflow models in regulated river basins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Urbanization and flooding</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/projects/flood-urbanization/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/projects/flood-urbanization/</guid><description>&lt;p>Floods are one of the costliest natural disasters both in terms of damages and human livelihood losses. Urban encroachment on floodplains increases exposure and vulnerability to floods while population changes and climate change are expected to exacerbate those risks. Although the mechanisms of how urbanization affects flood risk are relatively well understood, there have been limited efforts in assessing the degree of floodplain encroachment globally and how it has changed both in space and time. With the advent of big-data geospatial processing tools, global-scale reconstructions of flood risk and changes in urban area have been made available and by combining these datasets, we can assess how floodplains have urbanized in relation to flood risk globally.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lake ecosystems</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/projects/lakes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/projects/lakes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Human acceleration of eutrophication through continued watershed and lakeshore development, combined with changes in temperature and climate, increasingly challenges managers to meet human needs while protecting aquatic resources. While annual winter water level drawdowns (WDs) are commonly used to reduce nuisance macrophyte biomass, the future utility and impacts to ecosystems under climate change remains uncertain. Moreover, the timing and magnitude of drawdowns, which are affected by climate, influences the negative impacts of drawdowns on lake water quality and food webs. Using remote sensing data, validated with on-the-ground water level and cyanobacteria data, we will characterize water level fluctuations and cyanobacteria blooms in WD lakes coupled to novel hydrologic models that assess sensitivity of these lakes to future climate and precipitation. The results from this research, which will be shared in scientific publications, will help evaluate WDs as a macrophyte management tool under future climate change and weigh any remaining benefits with the ecological and socioeconomic costs of performing WDs. This research is a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), University of Massachusetts Amherst, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and seven state agencies, who will provide in-kind support for collection of field data and translate results into guidance for lake managers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A multi-sensor approach to characterize winter water level drawdown patterns in lakes</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/kumar2024/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/kumar2024/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hydrologic Consistency of Multi-Sensor Drought Observations in Forested Environments</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/andreadis2024/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/andreadis2024/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Xinchen He wins student award at NAB conference</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/news/24-02-15-neab-award/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/news/24-02-15-neab-award/</guid><description>&lt;p>Congratulations to Xinchen He who won an award for outstanding presentation!&lt;/p>

The latter requires integrating multiple models with observational data, but that can be problematic due to disparities in terms of scale or fidelity of each model. Scientific machine learning, which has exploded in popularity in recent years, could provide a novel and flexible way of fusing observations and models. This project aims to develop a data-driven modeling framework that can help stakeholders incorporate the impacts of climate change into future predictions of aquatic flows. The proposed team will convene a working group composed of local, state and federal resource managers who are responsible for mitigating the impacts of climate change caused by extreme hydrologic events on fish and wildlife. Informed by this working group, the researchers will develop the data-driven framework by adopting modern computational methods that facilitate communication and ensure that the actual users of this framework are involved with its development from the ground up. The focus area of the proposed research will be the Northeast US, although the modeling tool is robust and can be applied within any region of the United States. Detailed user documentation and a simple interface will allow resource managers to incorporate the modeling tool into their existing workflow, making its adoption more likely. Data volumes are not getting any smaller, with more observations and model output becoming available to everyone. The overarching goal of this research is to bring in the very promising area of scientific maching learning into the hands of interested users and resource managers, ensuring fair access to such tools and demonstrating a different paradigm for climate change science.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Urbanizing the floodplain: Global changes of imperviousness in flood-prone areas</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/andreadis2022b/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/andreadis2022b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Evaluation of Multi-scale SMAP Soil Moisture Products in Forested Environments</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/andreadis2022a/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/andreadis2022a/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Applications of remote sensing techniques to hydrologic research in Sub-Saharan Africa, with a special focus on the Congo basin</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/schumann2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/schumann2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Review of GPM IMERG performance: A global perspective</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/pradhan2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/pradhan2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Screening Tool for Dam Hazard Potential Classification Using Machine Learning and Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Tuning</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/kravits2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/kravits2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Probabilistic Evaluation of Drought in CMIP6 Simulations</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/papalexiou2021/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/papalexiou2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Evaluating the impacts of drought on rice productivity over Cambodia in the Lower Mekong Basin</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/abhishek2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/abhishek2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Exploring the factors controlling the performance of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission discharge algorithms</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/frasson2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/frasson2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Combining big-data remote sensing and global hydrologic modelling improves daily discharge estimates across an entire large watershed</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/ishitsuka2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/ishitsuka2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Constraining the assimilation of SWOT observations with hydraulic geometry relations</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/andreadis2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/andreadis2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Data Assimilation Framework for Generating Space‐Time Continuous Daily SWOT River Discharge Data Products</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/li2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/li2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Underlying Fundamentals of Kalman Filtering for River Network Modeling</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/emery2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/publication/emery2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Deploying JupyterHub on the Cloud</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/post/20-01-20-jupyter-hub/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/post/20-01-20-jupyter-hub/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m teaching a class on computational methods for environmental engineers this semester, and the language of choice is Python&lt;/p>
&lt;p>as it is simple enough for potentially novice programmers and has a very rich ecosystem of existing libraries that make life easier for any environmental engineer/scientist. As I have taught the class once before, I emphasized reproducibility which meant that
we used Jupyter notebooks for most of the class. The other aspect of the class that I found tremendously useful was live coding. Thankfully, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/damianavila/RISE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RISE extension&lt;/a> combines Jupyter notebooks with slideshows (powered by &lt;a href="https://revealjs.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reveal.js&lt;/a> presentation framework) and I ended up using it exclusively for preparing the lectures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although a good chunk of the class was spent with the students coding on their own with me going around answering questions, I decided to take it a step further by utilizing a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped%5Fclassroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipped classroom&lt;/a> approach and combining it with paired/grouped learning. Essentially the students go over some lecture material prior to class, and we spend most of the lecture time explaining anything that the students had trouble but leave enough time for groups of students to solve a coding problem (relevant to the lecture material of course). The last part of the lecture is spent going over the answers of each student group and answering any questions. This presents a technology issue: it would be too much of a hassle to connect each student&amp;rsquo;s laptop to the projector in order to show
their answers to the entire class. The answer would be to set up a server where the students can connect and solve the problem in Jupyter notebooks on the server. &lt;a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jupyter Hub&lt;/a> would be the solution, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have all the students connect to my laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s where the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH)&lt;/a> comes in, which is a distribution that helps you provide Jupyter Notebooks to 1-50 users on a single server (hosted on a cloud provider potentially). In this post, I will document how I set up TLJH on the Google Cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step involves logging in to the &lt;a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Console&lt;/a> and creating a new VM instance. You can keep the default options except for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Change the Boot Disk image from &lt;code>Debian GNU/Linux 9 (Stretch)&lt;/code> to &lt;code>Ubuntu 18.04 LTS&lt;/code>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After creating the VM and waiting a few minutes for TLJH to be installed, grab
the external IP of your VM (without the ~ &lt;a href="https://" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://&lt;/a> ~ part) and login to your new
server. If you click on the &lt;code>Control Panel&lt;/code> and the &lt;code>Admin&lt;/code> link, you can add
users (i.e. your students). Now we can have prepared Jupyter notebooks on the
cloud, that each student can work on and go over the problems/answers from a
single machine!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello world!</title><link>https://hydro-umass.github.io/post/20-01-19-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hydro-umass.github.io/post/20-01-19-hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every blog starts with one of these.
